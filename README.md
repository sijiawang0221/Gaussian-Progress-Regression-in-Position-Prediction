# Gaussian Progress Regression in Position Prediction

We investigate the dataset Relative location of CT slices on axial axis Data Set from UCI repository. The task is to predict the relative location (reference) of a given 2-dimensional slice of the body. The dataset is employed to validate the performance of GPR. Experimental results demonstrate an excellent performance of GPR, achieving a expected error of 1.5 cm.
